    <h2>Cheating Scripts Usage</h2>
    <p>Players found using cheating scripts will receive a temporary ban, which resets after the next server restart.</p>
    
    <h2>Chat Filter Bypass</h2>
    <p>Attempting to bypass the chat filter will result in a kick, with the possibility of a ban depending on the frequency of the offense.</p>
    
    <h2>VPN Detection Bypass</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you are banned and attempt to connect using a VPN, you will be banned again (the duration of the ban may vary).</li>
        <li>If you are not banned but use a VPN, you will be kicked from the server.</li>
    </ul>
    

  

    <h2>Game Integrity</h2>
    <ul>
  <li><strong>Cheating Mods:</strong> Use of any unauthorized mods or tools to gain an advantage is prohibited and will result in a temporary ban.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Appeals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ban Appeals:</strong> Players who feel they have been unjustly banned can claim a ticket on the discord server, but repeated appeals after being denied may lead to further punishment.</li>

    <h2>Changes to Rules</h2>
    <p>These rules may be modified at any time.</p>
