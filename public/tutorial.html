        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>
            When you first enter Arras2.io, you will be given control of a basic tank. Your goal is to survive and upgrade your tank by gaining experience points (XP) and levels. Here’s how to get started:
        </p>

        <h3>Controls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Use the W, A, S, D keys or arrow keys to move your tank.</li>
            <li><strong>Shooting:</strong> Click the left mouse button to shoot at nearby enemies.</li>
            <li><strong>Upgrade Points:</strong> As you gain experience, you will earn upgrade points that can be used to enhance your tank's abilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Shapes Overview</h3>
        <p>
            In Arras2.io, shapes are essential elements of gameplay that provide players with experience points (XP) and resources for upgrading their tanks. Here’s a breakdown of the different types of shapes and their significance:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic Shapes:</strong> These include common shapes such as squares, triangles, pentagons, hexagons, octogons and quadrons. Destroying these shapes grants players XP, which is crucial for leveling up and improving tank capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Mini Shapes:</strong> Smaller versions of basic shapes that appear frequently in the game. While they provide less XP than larger shapes, mini shapes are easier to destroy and can be a quick source of experience for new players or those looking to farm XP efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Rare Shapes:</strong> Occasionally, rare shapes will appear that grant significant XP or unique items. Players must compete to destroy these shapes, adding an element of excitement and competition to the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Spawn Points:</strong> Shapes also serve as spawn points for enemies or bosses. Understanding the locations of these shapes can help players anticipate enemy movements and strategize accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Dynamics:</strong> The presence and arrangement of shapes influence overall gameplay dynamics, encouraging exploration and combat engagement. Players must adapt their strategies based on the shapes available in their environment.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Overall, shapes are vital for creating an engaging and dynamic gameplay experience in Arras2.io. They serve as a primary source of XP, provide strategic advantages, and contribute to the game's tactical elements.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Tank Upgrades</h3>
        <p>
            Every time you level up, you will receive upgrade points that can be allocated to various aspects of your tank, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Body Damage:</strong> Increases the damage dealt by your tank when colliding with enemies. Higher body damage allows you to effectively ram other tanks, making it a useful skill for aggressive playstyles.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Max Health:</strong> Boosts the total health points of your tank, enhancing its overall durability. Higher max health allows you to withstand more damage from enemy attacks, making you harder to eliminate.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Bullet Speed:</strong> Increases the speed at which your bullets travel. Faster bullets can hit targets more effectively, making it easier to land shots on moving enemies.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Bullet Health:</strong> Determines how much damage your bullets can absorb before being destroyed. Higher bullet health allows your projectiles to survive longer in combat, enabling them to reach their targets even in heavy fire.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Bullet Penetration:</strong> Enhances your bullets' ability to pass through obstacles and enemy shields. Increased bullet penetration allows you to hit opponents who are taking cover, providing a tactical advantage in battles.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Bullet Damage:</strong> Boosts the damage dealt by your bullets upon impact. Higher bullet damage means each shot will inflict more harm on your enemies, making it essential for a powerful offensive build.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Reload:</strong> Reduces the time it takes to reload your weapon after firing. A faster reload speed allows you to shoot more frequently, increasing your overall damage output during engagements.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Movement Speed:</strong> Enhances the speed at which your tank moves around the battlefield. Increased movement speed improves your maneuverability, making it easier to evade attacks and position yourself strategically.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Shield Regeneration:</strong> Increases the rate at which your tank's shield regenerates after taking damage. A higher shield regeneration rate allows you to recover your defenses more quickly, providing better protection during prolonged fights.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Shield Capacity:</strong> Boosts the total amount of shield points your tank can have. A higher shield capacity means you can absorb more damage before your health starts to deplete, making you more resilient in combat.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Combat Strategy</h3>
        <p>
            To thrive in the arena, it’s crucial to develop effective combat strategies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aim for weaker enemies:</strong> Target lower-level tanks to gain quick XP.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay mobile:</strong> Constant movement makes you a harder target.</li>
            <li><strong>Use terrain:</strong> Utilize obstacles for cover and to ambush unsuspecting enemies.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Game Modes Overview</h3>
<p>
    Arras2.io offers various game modes that provide unique gameplay experiences. Here’s a breakdown of each mode:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>D-Day:</strong> In this team-based mode, players are divided into two teams: Blue and Red. The Blue team must destroy all Red dominators, while the Red team aims to protect few dominators for 8 minutes to win. Blue players can stop the Red team's timer by killing few dominators. The objective for Blue is to eliminate all Red dominators to secure victory.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Boss Rush:</strong> Players face multiple waves of powerful bosses. During certain waves, mysterious eggs spawn, offering players valuable rewards. The eggs include 5 regular mysterious eggs, 3 ultra mysterious eggs, 3 legendary mysterious eggs, 2 deadly mysterious eggs, and 1 ultimate mysterious egg, which only appears at wave 80. When a mysterious egg is destroyed, a friendly boss will join the player's team, with more powerful bosses joining as rarer eggs are destroyed. The destruction of the ultimate mysterious egg will summon the rarest and strongest friendly boss. Players must also protect their sanctuaries from the bosses, and if all sanctuaries are lost, they have 90 seconds to recover at least one. Failure to do so results in defeat. If players manage to beat wave 150, the game ends in victory.</li>


    
    <li><strong>Mothership:</strong> In this mode, inspired by Diep.io, players must defend their own mothership while attempting to destroy the enemy’s. Teamwork is essential to keep their mothership safe while launching coordinated attacks on the opposing team. If the enemy’s mothership is destroyed, the surviving mothership of the player's team is declared the winner.</li>

    
    <li><strong>Domination:</strong> Also inspired by Diep.io, this mode involves capturing and holding control dominators on the map. Teams gain dominators by holding these zones, with the aim of capturing all the dominators to win the match.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Closed Beta:</strong> A private server mode accessible only to premium users. Note that premium is not yet available but will be implemented in the future.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Core:</strong> In this team mode, players must stay within a designated yellow zone to continuously gain points. The team that reaches 10,000 points first wins the match.</li>
    
    <li><strong>FFA (Free-for-All):</strong> A classic mode where players compete individually against one another. The goal is to achieve the highest score by eliminating other players.</li>

    <li><strong>2TDM (Team Deathmatch 2):</strong> Players form two teams and compete to achieve the highest score by eliminating opponents.</li>
    
    <li><strong>MAZE:</strong> Players navigate through a maze while battling enemies, aiming to achieve the highest score by surviving and eliminating opponents.</li>
    
    <li><strong>4TDM (4 Team Deathmatch):</strong> Involves four teams competing against each other, with the goal of accumulating the highest score through eliminations.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth:</strong> In this mode, players grow stronger and larger with each tank or shape they destroy. As you eliminate targets, your tank’s size and power increase, adding an exciting layer of progression to the battle. Aim to dominate by becoming the biggest and most formidable force in the arena!</li>
<li><strong>Hide and Seek:</strong> In this mode, players take on the role of hiders, attempting to escape and hide from dangerous seekers for 3 minutes. Hiders must avoid detection and survive for the entire duration to succeed.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Superpowers Overview</h3>
<p>
    In Arras2.io, players can harness powerful abilities to enhance their gameplay experience. Here’s a look at the superpowers available:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Star Power:</strong> Activating this power increases your speed, grants invulnerability, allows you to grow larger, enhances your body damage, and raises your level for 15 seconds. This all-around boost makes you a formidable force on the battlefield.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Speed Boost:</strong> This power allows you to run even faster than with Star Power, giving you an edge in mobility for 30 seconds. It’s perfect for dodging attacks or quickly repositioning during intense battles.</li>
